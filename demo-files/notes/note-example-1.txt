Patient came in today complaining of bad headaches for 3 days now. Says it's throbbing pain in the front of the head, pretty severe, maybe 7 out of 10. Light bothers her eyes and she feels a bit nauseous. No fever though. Been taking ibuprofen but not helping much. She has high blood pressure but takes meds for it. No allergies. Didn't hit her head or anything.

Checked her vitals - blood pressure 135 over 85, heart rate 78, temperature normal at 98.6. She looks uncomfortable but knows where she is and everything. Did neuro check, all looks good, no weird symptoms.

Thinking this is either tension headache or maybe migraine. Going to give her sumatriptan 50mg to try. Told her to work on stress, maybe keep track of when headaches happen. Come back in 2 weeks or sooner if it gets worse. If no better might need to do a CT scan.
