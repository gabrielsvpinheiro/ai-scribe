Follow-up visit for patient, had knee surgery 2 weeks ago, arthroscopy on right knee for meniscus tear. He's a pretty active guy, 52 years old. Says knee still hurts but the pain meds are helping. Still some swelling but getting better each day. He's doing physical therapy 3 times a week and doing his exercises at home like we told him.

Checked the incision - looks clean, healing well, no redness or pus or anything concerning. Can bend the knee to about 90 degrees now which is good progress. He's using crutches and only putting some weight on it like we discussed. Pain is about 4 out of 10, mostly when he moves it. Checked for blood clots - no pain in the calf, no swelling, looks good.

Knee is healing up nicely after the surgery. Keep taking the pain meds as needed. He can start putting more weight on it when it feels okay. Keep going to PT, they'll work on getting more movement and making it stronger. Can ditch the crutches when he feels ready. See him again in 4 weeks. Told him what to watch for - signs of infection or blood clots. He can go back to work next week at his desk job, just needs to keep leg elevated when possible.
