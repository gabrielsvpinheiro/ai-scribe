Home visit today for Mrs. Johnson, 78 years old with diabetes. She's having trouble keeping her blood sugar under control. Been checking at home and it's been high, like 180 to 220 in the mornings. She lives by herself, does okay taking care of herself. Takes metformin 1000mg twice a day and glipizide 5mg once daily. She admits she's been eating too many sweets and not eating at regular times.

Looked at her feet - had an ulcer on the left foot before but it's all healed up now, looks good. Can feel her pulses in her feet. No swelling. She can see fine with her glasses.

Blood pressure 142 over 88, heart rate 72, weight is 165 pounds same as last time. Her A1C from last month was 8.2 which is too high.

Her diabetes isn't controlled well, probably because she's not eating right. The foot ulcer is healed which is good. Going to increase her metformin to three times a day with meals. Setting her up with a nutritionist to help with diet. Also getting a home health aide to help with meal planning. She needs to check blood sugar weekly and write it down. Will see her again in 3 weeks. Keep doing the foot care stuff. Talked to her about how important it is to take meds and eat better.
